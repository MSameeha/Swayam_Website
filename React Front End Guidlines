Use the DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself).
Create multiple files instead of writing a big file.
Place all your CSS files in one common folder.
Use Inline CSS only if there is less than one styling to be applied.
Review your code before creating a pull request.
Split your code into multiple smaller functions. Each with a single responsibility.
Name your files logically according to the job that they perform. (For example, a good name for a login functionality file can be login.js)
Clean code is self-commenting(using the right variable names and function names). Use comments only to explain complex functions.
Write the import statements for modules and libraries in an alphabetical order.
Leave an empty space after each function/block fo code
Don't write anything in the index.js file
