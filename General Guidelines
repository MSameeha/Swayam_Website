Use tabs not spaces for indentation. No, like seriously, use TABS
Ensure that you name the variables appropriately.
The class names should follow the standards mentioned below:
  1. It should have the elements name in it (a classname for button elemenent would be btn)
  2. The element tyoe should follow the name (if the button is for submitting stuff, then the class name would be btn-submit)
  3. Write the CSS file in the order of the elements (if div comes before button in html, then div styling should be infront of button in the css file)
  4. Name all the files appropriately (a good name for a file containing authentication routes would be 'auth.js')
  
NEVER PUSH DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH. First, push the new code to a different branch and then create a pull request.
Stick to the tasks given to you. If you find any discrepancy in code pushed by others, immediately create an issue.
